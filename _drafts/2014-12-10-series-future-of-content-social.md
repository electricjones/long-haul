excerpt: This post is part of The Future of Digital Content series, which discusses six traits I believe will be at the heart what content will look like in the coming years. These traits form a roadmap that lies at the heart of my research and experiments. The traits also work together, mixing and meshing, to paint a picture of how our future selves may read, watch, learn, and listen.

This may seem obvious to most people, after all Facebook and Twitter and all the rest have basically taken over the world. Of course our content will be promoted on social media. Of course authors will use twitter. Of course readers will review books online.

Obviously content will be social.

But is that all? What could social **really** mean?

Beyond content that is shared, tweeted, digged, forked, thrown, liked, hated and reviewed, content will be integrated into life. The content we love will be a hub of our social lives, almost like the centers of tiny universes. You see, social is about a lot more than sharing, posting, and sending. It's about trust, exploration, and human nature.

## Narrative Identity

On the [research](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/research) part of my site, I talk a lot about the concept of "[Narrative Identity](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/research/series-narrative-identity/)". In a quick review, here's how the idea plays out. We each tell stories about ourselves, to ourselves. I may tell the story of a dashing man with an awesome wife who is an avid reader, innovator, storyteller, and researcher. He likes _Star Trek_, vintage video games, and cats. I have an entire history, and entire story built up of me. My wife's story is different: football, thrillers, technology, running, and creative art. These elements, these attributes, form our **personal identity narrative**.

Without realize it, we try to tell this story to others through our speech, actions, clothing, and all manner of "performances." My **performative identity** looks like _Star Trek_ quotes, video game t-shirts, and jokes about cats. My wife wears running gear, colorful things she makes, and talks like a geek. We let people know who we are by the things we do, say, and wear. Others can figure out what we are trying to say because of **shared cultural resources**. T-shirts with Atari symbols are hints to others who know the symbol that "hey, that guy must be into classic games."

I have written a lot on the topic, but a good place to start is by exploring [Anime Fans](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/research/series-the-triad-narrative-identity-and-anime-fandom/).

In any case, it is the "shared cultural resources" that we are interested in. These resources are often **content** that people interact with. They build friendships around, and define themselves through, this content.

## Virtual and Real Life

So, content is already social, even if we didn't think of it that way. But, technology is allowing us to make content _really_ social in cool ways. Virtual sociality allows people to tweet about their stories, ask questions about that new article, find others who are into Advanced Basket Weaving, or whatever floats our boat. We can connect with people around content, using this cultural resource to share ideas, laughs, and tears.

Non-Virtual Sociality brings these things into the real world. Every time you talk with a co-worker about the new _Star Wars_ movie (I originally wrote this as _Star Wars VII_ premiered), you are being social around content.

Social doesn't just mean social media, it means "integrated into life and others."

## How Will Content Be Social?

Onto the fun stuff! What could social content look like?

#### Shared

Successful content in the future won't just hope people tweet, but will be actively sharable. A campaign strategy, quotes and quips, images, and evocative topics will drive people to share with their virtual world. Even more important is a two-way discussion. People like to engage with each other and the content creators.

#### Curated

Reviews, bumps, boosts, dislikes, and favorites -- all will be vital as the internet continues to change the way we consume content. Readers want to know what their friends, trusted experts, and even total stranger have to say about content.

#### Reader to Reader

Readers (or audiences) want to connect with other readers _around_ content. Many times, an interest in a particular piece of content means shared interests in other areas. Any content that provides people with a way to be social beyond just the content itself will have a serious leg up.

#### Author and Reader

More than just "behind the scenes," this means that the content creator(s) are _part of_ the community targeted by the content. They live where the readers live (even if not geographically). When readers can be social with the author, magic happens.

#### Reader and Characters

This is my favorite. The idea that readers can interact with fictional characters is exciting. And, this doesn't have to stay in the realm of fiction. Interacting with historical figures, experts in whatever field, and "guides" through a certain topic can bring content to an entirely new level.

#### And More Than We Can Imagine

This is just the start. The future is going to be awesome.

That wraps up five out of the six traits of "The Future of Content."

1.  **[Mulit-access](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-multi-access/)** - We want our content delivered in many different ways.
2.  **[Multi-modal](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-mixed-media/)** - We want content that includes several forms of communication (video, text, sound, etc)
3.  **[Interactive](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-interactive/)** - We want to take control of our destiny (or content). It should respond to us. Personalized.
4.  [**Collaborative**](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-collaborative/) - Working together with readers and other creators to build something more than we could ourselves.
5.  **Social** - In real live and in cyberspace, social between authors, characters, and readers.
