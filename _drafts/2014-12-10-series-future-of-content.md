excerpt: This post is part of The Future of Digital Content series, which discusses six traits I believe will be at the heart what content will look like in the coming years. These traits form a roadmap that lies at the heart of my research and experiments. The traits also work together, mixing and meshing, to paint a picture of how our future selves may read, watch, learn, and listen.

I am a researcher, storyteller, and technologist. Nowhere does that all come together more than in the exploration of how content is evolving. I research how people interact with content and education. I tell stories that are mixed-media and interactive. I build tools and apps that help authors and geeks work together to make awesome content experiences.

the lines are blurring between different kinds of content. Books are becoming websites. Music is meshing with film. Websites and apps are taking over.

Not only is content presentation changing, but the content itself is evolving. Stories are interactive. Articles include videos. Everything is online and part of a conversation between reader and maker.

My research and experiments are about pushing these trends into new places. Those involved in the revolution want to erase the lines that divide presentations (books, movies, websites) so that the content itself gets the show it deserves.

This series explores what the future of digital content might look like. How will books and websites evolve together? Where to games fit in? How will we read, watch, learn, relax, and engage with all the stuff we love in 5, 10, or 20 years?

I focus **six traits of content in the future**. These traits are my roadmap in most of my research, stories, and experiments. I would like to share them with you and get feedback on how _you_ think content will evolve.

### 1. [Multi-Access](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-multi-access/ "The Future of Content: Multi-Access")

You want your content your way. And you want to access your content in multiple ways.

### 2. [Mixed Media and Multimodal](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-mixed-media/ "The Future of Content: Mixed-Media")

Content will not just be one thing. A story will alternate between pictures, text, and audio. Articles will include videos. And they will engage more than just one or two senses.

### 3. [Interactive](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-interactive/ "The Future of Content: Interactive")

Bonus features and behind-the-scenes videos are interactive, but what about letting the reader actually change the story as it goes. Or movies where the audience talks with the characters. Oh, and personalized, too.

### 4. [Collaborative](http://chrismichaelsauthor.com/innovation/future-of-content-collaborative/ "The Future of Content: Collaborative")

Maker and Audience are distinctions that are starting to fade. We can all work together to build content that is something unlike any one person could have planned.

### 5. Social

Yes, content will be shared, tweeted, digged, forked, thrown, liked, hated, reviewed, and even more. Content will be integrated into life.

### 6. Immersive and Expansive

Stories have universes, and we want to explore more than just the small part we see in a video or read in a book. Immersive means that we will be able to surround ourselves and explore content on our own terms. Expansive means that content will link together with other content.

_Stick with me as I explore what each of these mean and we discuss how to push digital content forward into the future._
