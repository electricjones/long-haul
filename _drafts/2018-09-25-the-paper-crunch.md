excerpt: Writing and submitting 4 papers in the space of a month...you get the idea.

The UH Gaming Lab has been kind enough to let me into their ranks. 
We are between 5 and 7, a professor, a number of grad students, some visiting professors, and me.
The lab doesn't specifically focus on Gaming, but also AR/VR technologies and their application.
Human Computer Interaction stuff. It's a really enthusiastic, bright, and hard working group of people. 
I am very lucky to be a part of it, especially since I am not actually a Ph.D. student, yet.
I have several prerequisites to work out, and am diligently going through those.

In any case, I started working with the lab at the end of last semester, and have been through the summer.
When I started, they were at the finishing phases of developing a prototype for an AR (Microsoft Hololens) application that was meant to replace or supplement a course assessment in a Construction Safety Management Class.
The tech was pretty cool. It projected a diorama of a live construction scene and asked the students to examine it and mark situations and behaviors as safe or unsafe.

They had finished the prototype, in conjunction with the school of Construction Management, and were beginning to design a study to test its effectiveness.
I was able to lend some of my expertise in qualitative data analysis and help design the study itself.
It was pretty simple. We gave the students a traditional pen-and-paper assessment, the Hololens Trial, and a couple before and after surveys asking about their experience and some demographics.
Lastly, we did a small group debrief, asking more significant qualitative questions.

We got some good data, and was able to correlate the data between the two assessments with the participant responses.
I won't go any more into the study itself, since we have 3 papers on submission right now.

The fourth project was a paper documenting the gamification of a game design class. 
The professor had been using a "Duel" competition strategy for a number of years, and we wrote up the data on its effectiveness.

Those were cool, but this is about the paper writing process.
It was a frenzy! For a lot of reasons, some out of our control and others not, things came down to the wire.
I am not sure if this is normal in academia, but I sure hear that it often is. 
We ended up spending several nights over [Slack](http://slack.com) and various other collaboration platforms writing, editing, revising, and chewing through the papers.
The lead authors all spent nights into the morning finishing it up. I wrote most of the "Related Works" sections, and helped with others.

I am really proud of the work we did. It was a great experience, but I definitely learned a few things for next time:
- Plan ahead, it will take longer than you expect.
- Write your abstract early.
- Outline before you begin writing.
- Don't worry about "too many" words. Cut later.
- Do data analysis well before you start writing the paper. Know what you want to say. The paper is about *how* to say it.
- Get to know the journal/conference well before writing. Each one has different emphasis.
- Have lots of coffee and good people on your team who care :)

Overall, I'm really glad we did it, and I'm (obviously) hoping for good responses. We'll see in the end.

Even if they are not accepted, it was an amazing experience, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
But, next time, we will be more prepared and plan things out a little more in advance.
If we stretch the writing over a longer period of time, we lose less of our minds.

Oh, the joys of being human -- procrastination and scrambling.
