excerpt: I introduce The Future of Digital Content series, which discusses six traits I believe will be at the heart what content will look like in the coming years.

I am a researcher, storyteller, and computer scientist. Nowhere does that all come together more than in the exploration of how content is evolving. I research how people interact with content and education. I tell stories that are mixed-media and interactive. I build tools and apps that help authors and geeks work together to make awesome content experiences.

The lines are blurring between different kinds of content. Books are becoming websites. Music is meshing with film. Websites and apps are taking over.

Not only is content presentation changing, but the content itself is evolving. Stories are interactive. Articles include videos. Everything is online and part of a conversation between reader and maker.

My research and experiments are about pushing these trends into new places. Those involved in the revolution want to erase the lines that divide presentations (books, movies, websites) so that the content itself gets the show it deserves.

This series explores what the future of digital content might look like. How will books and websites evolve together? Where to games fit in? How will we read, watch, learn, relax, and engage with all the stuff we love in 5, 10, or 20 years?

I focus **six traits of content in the future**. These traits are my roadmap in most of my research, stories, and experiments. I would like to share them with you and get feedback on how _you_ think content will evolve.

You want your content your way. And you want to access your content in multiple ways.
