With all the noise on the interwebs, why is there yet another blog? In short, because I wanted there to be.

I am a Game Sciences researcher, pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a Focus on Gaming Science.
That may sound unusual because it's not really a thing. There are *very few* if *any* truly focused research programs for Game Studies or Game Sciences.
In most cases, these faculty live inside departments like Computer Science, Psychology, Communication, Art, and just about everywhere else.
This is not unusual. This is not even necessarily bad.

But, Gaming is an important topic -- a central part of the human experience for virtually all people across all time.
Gaming is worth studying, and that research **is being done**.

What I found, though, is a lack of centralized spaces, resource, lists, and guides.
For Game Studies and Game Sciences, the individual must cobble together threads and resources from vast corners of academia, corners that don't normally talk to each other.

This blog -- this site -- is my attempt at centralizing some of those artifacts.
