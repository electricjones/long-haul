- More than 150 million Americans play video games, and 64 percent of American households are home to at least one person who plays video games regularly, or at least three hours per week.
- 60 percent of Americans play video games daily.
- The average gamer is 34 years old and 72 percent are age 18 or older. Women age 18 and older represent a significantly greater portion of the video game-playing population (33 percent) than boys under age 18 (17 percent).
- Most parents (70 percent) say video games are a positive part of their childâ€™s life. Most parents (67 percent) also play video games with their child at least once weekly and 94 percent say they pay attention to the video games played by their child.

And those are just videogames. 
Gaming is part of every culture, and a definitive, powerful part of the human experience.

When I decided that Game Sciences (from a Computer Science perspective) was going to be my research career, I searched high and low for the best way to move forward.
Obviously, the first step was to finish a Ph.D. in Game Studies, as my end goal was to be a research professor. 
I figured finding those programs would be the easy part.

I was wrong.

In the cross-discipline field of Game Studies (or as I prefer, Game Sciences), 
    I found a lack of centralized spaces, resource, lists, and guides, not to speak of graduate programs dedicated to an important part of the human experience.
Unfortunately, there are *very few* if *any* truly focused research programs for Game Studies or Game Sciences (especially in the United States).
In most cases, Game Studies faculty live inside departments like Computer Science, Psychology, Communication, Art, and just about everywhere else.

*See [Getting a Game Studies PhD](http://ourglasslake.com/getting-into-game-studies/) by Bonnie Ruberg for an excellent overview of programs and tracks*

This means that an individual must cobble together threads and resources from vast corners of academia, corners that don't normally talk to each other.

Enter this Blog. 
There will be formal collections of resources, guides, and literature reviews on various wriings of Game Studies.
But, this is also meant to be a window into my journey as I try to carve out my place on this amazing, but burgeoning field.

There are a couple specific features to be aware of.
1. The posts run the spectrum between informal and formal. 
    Some posts are essentially drafts of academic papers. 
    Some are musings and ramblings. 
    I try to tag and describe them so you know what you're getting into.
2. Several posts are continuously updated. See the tag [constantly-updated](/tags/constantly-updated)
3. As I am essentially building my own degree in Game Sciences (emphasis on Computer Science), I am keeping a journal. 
    This is the super informal one. See [journal](/tags/journal)
4. Always open to feedback. This is meant to be a grand introduction to Game Sciences!

Gaming is an important topic -- a central part of the human experience for virtually all people across all time.
Gaming is worth studying, and that research **is being done**. Join us!
