This post is a running ledger about my coursework in pursuit of a graduate education in Computer Science. I am almost entirely self-taught and have always wanted a more formal course plan. To that end, I have been taking various prerequisites to a Master's In Computer Science and (likely) a PhD in Computer Science.

As a bit of therapy, this blog post keeps track of my progress, the classes I take, and some general thoughts and feelings about them.

I hope this is helpful to someone else, but if not, it'll be good for my O.C.D. soul.

The list is sorted from most recent to those I took first.

### Official Classes
#### Discrete Math
**Summer 2020 - Prerequisite**


#### Precalculus (Formal)
**Spring 2020- Prerequisite**

### Statistics
**Fall 2020 - Prerequisite**

### Computer Architecture
**Spring 2019**
This was an entirely fascinating class. Most of it I had introduced myself to over the years, but never had a truly formal introduction. We did all the typical things: Discussed Architectures, Programmed in Assembly, and touched on Parallel Programming and GPUs. I found this so intoxicating that I have continued with it in my spare time.

#### DONE: Programming Fundamentals III
**Fall 2018 - Prerequisite**

This is a prerequisite computing course required to apply to the University of Houston.
I understand why it is required, but my current position as a professional software developer at [FBS](http://flexmls.com) and my previous programming experience makes this class a bit redundant.
The focus is on Data Structures and a little big of Algorithm Analysis.

I am actually excited about this class, even if most of the information is a refresher for me, primarily because it is in C++, a language I have used infrequently.

I will have more to say about this course as time goes on.  

#### DONE: Pre-calculus (EDX)
**Summer and Fall 2018 - Prerequisite**
I have two Master's Degrees, but nothing in Science or Math. 
Actually, the last math class I had was High School Geometry, many many years ago.
As prerequisites to the Ph.D. program, I have to take `Calculus I`, `Calculus II`, and `Linear Algebra`, but am not even ready for Calculus.
That leaves me doing a self-learning regiment to prepare for the Accuplacer test so that I can enter Calculus in the Spring of 2019.

I love [Edx](http://edx.org) and [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org). 
Together, those two platforms are giving me all the resources I need to get up to speed in my math-ninja skills.

Specifically, I
* Watched and worked through about 50 videos on Khan Academy to get "in the math zone" and to brush up on the *real* basics, like algebra and basic geometry.
* Took the official accuplacer sample questions and did **terribly**.
* Watched someone who actually knows what their talking about do those problems at [blackpenredpen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQ6niIcLDM)

All of that gave me a pretty good understanding of what my goal was. Now, it is time to actually work through the Pre-Calculus topics

I found on Edx an **awesome** [course from Arizona State University](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ASUx+MAT170x+2T2017/course/) that began with a detailed pretest and showed me exactly where I needed to grow.
It then let me set the pace, offered fantastic tools, and good instruction. When I'm stuck, I still go to Khan Academy.
So, that's where I am now. Every day, I do at least 3 units.

Once I finish up with that course, I am going to go back into Accuplacer test prep mode.

I may also take [another Edx Pre-calculus Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+Calc001x+3T2017/course/), but am not going to make that decision right now.

#### DONE: Programming Fundamentals II
**Summer 2018 - Prerequisite**
My first programming experiences were on my Apple IIe in fourth grade. I am currently a professional software developer for FBS, Creators of Flexmls.
Still, `Object Oriented Programming` is a basic requirement I was not able to get waived, so I took it at a local community college, San Jacinto.
Honestly, the class was great. It was a nice refresher and I learned some of the terms for things I'd been doing forever.
Plus it was an easy `A`.

### Additional Classes
These are formal, but non-mandated classes about topics I feel I need, like Educational Psychology, Game Design, and Computer Science.
Included in this list are structured, professional courses. 
Some are at a local university. 

Others are on platforms like [EdX](https://edx.org), [Coursera](https://coursera.com), and [https://udemy.com](Udemy).

- [CS50's Introduction to Game Development](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/)
- [Instructional Design Models](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:USMx+LDT200x+1T2018_2/course/)
- [Instructional Design and Technology: Learning Theories](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:USMx+LDT100x+2T2018/course/)
- EdTechX: Educational Technology
    - [Implementation and Evaluation of Educational Technology](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.133x_2+2T2016/course/)
    - [Introduction to Game Design](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.126x_2+1T2016/course/)
    - [Design and Development of Games for Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.127x_2+3T2016/course/)
    - [Design and Development of Educational Technology](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+11.132x_3+1T2017/course/)

#### DONE: [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)
**Fall 2018 - Extra**
Easily the best introduction to Computer Science I've ever seen. A fantastic breakdown of the entire stack with working examples.
It is engaging, challenging, and **well worth the time**

### Independent Studies
This are topics that I just cant find a course on, so  I'm building my own. 
Most of them are working through a textbook or other material on my own (doing all the work and some additional studying as well).
