# My Journey
> "Life is a journey, not a destination.‚Äù - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Not a big fan of Emerson, but it's a great quote. 
And -- when you're staring down the business of a Ph.D. -- that journey feels like it's going to take forever.

This post is an almost-diary about my coursework in pursuit of a Ph.D. in Computer Software. 
I am largely engineering my own focus in `Games and Learning Sciences`, so I include additional course and independent study resources.

As a bit of therapy, this blog post keeps track of my progress, the classes I take, and some general thoughts and feelings about them.
I am working toward a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Houston, but do not have formal degrees in science or engineering.
I do have masters degrees in both Educational Psychology and Anthropology, and I've been programming since I was in middle school. 
So, I have some prerequisites to clear out before I start the actual course work.

I hope this is helpful to someone else, but if not, it'll be good for my O.C.D. soul.

The list is sorted from most recent to those I took first.

## Current Classes
### Programming Fundamentals III
**Fall 2018 - Prerequisite**

This is a prerequisite computing course required to apply to the University of Houston.
I understand why it is required, but my current position as a professional software developer at [FBS](http://flexmls.com) and my previous programming experience makes this class a bit redundant.
The focus is on Data Structures and a little big of Algorithm Analysis. 
I am actually excited about this class, even if most of the information is a refresher for me, primarily because it is in C++, a language I have used infrequently.

I will have more to say about this course as time goes on.  

### Pre-calculus
**Summer and Fall 2018 - Prerequisite**
I have two Master's Degrees, but nothing in Science or Math. 
Actually, the last math class I had was High School Geometry, many many years ago.
As prerequisites to the Ph.D. program, I have to take `Calculus I`, `Calculus II`, and `Linear Algebra`, but am not even ready for Calculus.
That leaves me doing a self-learning regiment to prepare for the Accuplacer test so that I can enter Calculus in the Spring of 2019.

I love [Edx](http://edx.org) and [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org). 
Together, those two platforms are giving me all the resources I need to get up to speed in my math-ninja skills.

Specifically, I
* Watched and worked through about 50 videos on Khan Academy to get "in the math zone" and to brush up on the *real* basics, like algebra and basic geometry.
* Took the official accuplacer sample questions and did **terribly**.
* Watched someone who actually knows what their talking about do those problems at [blackpenredpen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQ6niIcLDM)

All of that gave me a pretty good understanding of what my goal was. Now, it is time to actually work through the Pre-Calculus topics

I found on Edx an **awesome** [course from Arizona State University](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ASUx+MAT170x+2T2017/course/) that began with a detailed pretest and showed me exactly where I needed to grow.
It then let me set the pace, offered fantastic tools, and good instruction. When I'm stuck, I still go to Khan Academy.
So, that's where I am now. Every day, I do at least 3 units.

Once I finish up with that course, I am going to go back into Accuplacer test prep mode.

I may also take [another Edx Pre-calculus Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+Calc001x+3T2017/course/), but am not going to make that decision right now.

## Finished Classes (yay!)
### Programming Fundamentals II
**Summer 2018 - Prerequisite**
My first programming experiences were on my Apple IIe in middle school. I am currently a professional software developer for FBS, Creators of Flexmls.
Still, `Object Oriented Programming` is a basic requirement I was not able to get waived, so I took it at a local community college, San Jacinto.
Honestly, the class was great. It was a nice refresher and I learned some of the terms for things I'd been doing forever.
Plus it was an easy `A`.

### [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)
**Fall 2018 - Extra**
Easily the best introduction to Computer Science I've ever seen. A fantastic breakdown of the entire stack with working examples.
It is engaging, challenging, and **well worth the time**
