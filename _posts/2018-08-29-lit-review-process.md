***I talk through an example review. You can see the finished result in [Literature Review of Gamification]({% post_url 2018-09-06-gamification-literature-review %})***

There are many resources out there for writing a literature review, most notably resources from University libraries. These are excellent:
- [Literature Reviews](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/literature-reviews/) by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- [Guidelines for writing a literature review ](http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~hrallis/guides/researching/litreview.html) by University of Minnesota Duluth
- [Write a Literature Review](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/write-a-literature-review) by UC Santa Cruz

I, however, wanted to add something more specific and concrete to these guides. 
I wanted to lay out my actually steps for doing a literature review, not for class, but for an actual research paper I am submitting to a peer-reviewed conference or journal.
The literature review required my many (especially graduate) classes is comprehensive and important, but there aren't many sources aimed at graduate students and new researchers who are writing their first academic papers.

A few notes:
- I specifically use Zotero to manage my sources and keep my notes. There are others like EndNote and Mendeley that I'm sure work just as well.
- The hardest part is getting it **short enough**. Depending on your paper, a full-journal page may be too long.
- The sources you choose matter, and the number matters, too.
- A Literature Review is different from Preliminary Research or an Annotated Bibliography.
    - Preliminary Research is what you do before and while designing your experiment. It's what you build to prove to yourself (and some others) that it's worth doing. It's also used to form your hypothesis. This isn't usually published or shared.
    - An Annotated Bibliography is basically the first part of a Literature Review. You just collect as many sources as possible, and follow threads to other less related topics. Next, they are grouped, and at least some are annotated. These usually aren't shared.
    - A Literature Review can draw from these, but this is the part you share with other researchers. See the next section for more details about what it actually is.
- Next week, I will post an example of a literature review I did for some papers my research group is submitting this month.

### 1. Why do we do Literature Reviews?
- For those not in the field, but interested in the topic.
    - This should be a short introduction with just enough background and definition for someone in another field to be able to understand what's happening.
    For instance, many Computer Science papers cross into disciplines like Medicine because they are building medical applications. 
    In this case, a Literature Review provides enough about the medical procedure and the computer science for the members of the other discipline who are reading.
- To situate your work in the broader context.
    - Explain where your research fits with other studies.
    We will discuss the upside down pyramid in a bit.
- To describe your theoretical and methodological framework. The choices you made.
    - You don't talk about the choices directly, but if you are using an analytic framework, this is a good place to show that the framework is valid and why you will be using it.
- To build on the shoulders of giants.
- To prove you know what you are talking about.
- Because they make you.

### 2. Finding and Sorting Sources
I'm going to use an example as we walk through this. You can see the end result in [Literature Review of Gamification](./2018-09-06-gamification-literature-review.md)
My research group recently submitted several papers that all dealt with gamification and game based learning, in some way.
I was given the task of a basic literature review of gamification that we could draw from in the different papers.

I use a tool called Zotero to organize all my sources. It integrates with the browser, so you can save a source whenever you come across one on Google Scholar or a database. It also allows you to keep notes, tags, and all sorts of things.

I always have it running, and I'm constantly dumping stuff into it. If it's vaguely interesting, I collect it and file it with tags. I can always search later.

I also try (once a week) to take 30-60 minutes to just skim through sources I've saved recently. I mark some that I want to read in depth and add small notes or update my tags.

When searching for new things. I use Google Scholar first, and then a discipline specific site, and then something like JSTOR.

#### Hunting and Gather
All that said, here's how I find my actual sources for a Review:

1. write down the important topics I thought were important. 
Think about the "Why do we do Literature Reviews."
In my case, things like "what is gamification?" "does it work?" "competition in gamification" (one of our papers was about that). And so on.
2. Look through what you have (that's the Zotero Library and any previous Reviews)
3. Ask others and get the most important sources. These are things that probably came up in Preliminary Research or that you just know because this is what you do.
4. Look through the "Works Cited" of anything you know you have so far.
5. Try to find studies that are *exactly* what you've done.
6. Look through the "Works Cited" of anything you know you have so far.
7. Search for the tings you listed above.
8. Look through the "Works Cited" of anything you know you have so far.

#### Make Sense
Like I said, I use Zotero. It pulls the abstract already. I always read the abstract and then the conclusion first.
This plus 

1. the date, 
2. how many times its cited (Google Scholar will show that to you), and 
3. what journal it is in

will usually give a a good idea about how useful it is.
I give mine a star rating.

I also pull out any quotes or interesting facts and save them as a note on the source in Zotero.

After that, I go through the high star ones and read them more deeply, taking actual notes. 
I am usually looking for something specific, like "this one should give me a good definition", but am always open to a new rabbit trail.

All this is still based off of the topic list from Step 1.
 
### 3. Structure Your Review
Now that I have a kind-of sorted source list, I think about the actual Review.

I sort the topics list into sections. In my case, like: 
- "What is Gamification?" 
- "Benefits of Gamification" 
- "Gamification in Classrooms."

### 4. Compiling Sources
Now, I can look through my sorted sources and start moving the quotes I've grabbed into the sections.
This part is usually, literally copy-and-paste. I just move two definitions into the first part, two lists of benifits into the second, etc.

I will look through the sources again and pull out the part that I find interesting. The things I think are important.

### 5. Drafting Pass 1 and 2
Now, I have a totally plagiarized clipboard fire. I set that aside, structure my review again, and start the actuall writing.

I will still pull in lots of quotes here. Reviews can have lots of quotes. Leave quotes long here.
I also pull (word for word) parts that I *don't* want to be a quote, but I know I want to paraphrase of mix, or keep.

I color code these: black is entirely my words, blue is for direct quotes, and green is for stuff to paraphrase.

The second pass is meant to rewrite the green and trim the blue down to what I actually want it to be.

**I want to be clear**, I am not just majorly rewording the green ones. 
I am taking similar ideas from multiple sources and describing them in my own words.
And you still cite these.

Don't be afraid of lots of citations. That's what this is supposed to be.

Zotero makes this easy. 

### 6. Edit
Once I feel like it is complete and my own work (with good quotes), I can edit it and move it around, and polish.

By the end, I have a standalone Literature Review on a topic that will be helpful not just for this project, but probably for the future.

### 7. Cut and fit it into the paper
Now, it is time to look at your paper(s). Each paper has different requirements. 
Again, think about the "Why Do We Do Literature Reviews" list, and think specifically about this paper.

- How does **this** study need situated?
- What definitions and background does **this** paper need?
- What theoretical frameworks does **this** paper use?

Honestly, this hurts. Literature Reviews are important, but often a much shorter section that others. It depends of the kind of paper and the discipline, though.

I have never made it through this process without cutting **at least half** of my Literature Review.
But, I can use cut parts elsewhere. I've never felt like I **wasted** anything, as backwards as that sounds.

### And That's It!
That's how I approach Literature Reviews. It sounds like a lot (and it is), but it is doable, and effective.

As a reference, in the companion review, I spent about:
- 1 hour preparing for my review, making my topic list, and figuring out what it needed to cover.
- 1 hour looking through my current sources and weighting them for **this** paper (I made a new collection). A lot of them already had notes. This wasn't my first rodeo.
- 2 hours just collecting new sources and looking through works cited. Didn't do much reading, just grabbing
- 2 hours browsing through my new sources and sorting them, grabbing good quotes
- 2 hours structuring and compiling my sources
- 1 hour drafting
- 1 hour editing

And, of course, I didn't do it all in one go. 
That was over about 2 weeks (while also holding down a job and working on other parts of the paper. And being married.)

I hope this was helpful to someone. Please feel free to comment with your own thoughts. I will revise this as I get better and learn more.
