***In [My Literature Review Process]({% post_url 2018-08-29-lit-review-process %}), I walked through an example of creating a literature review for a number of shared research papers. This is the final result. This review was cut up and used in at least three papers submitted to conferences and journals.***

### Gamification and Gaming Principles
Gamification is the act of applying the techniques found in game design to typically non-game domains such as business[44, 24, 15] and education[18, 27, 16]. While certainly not new, the rise of video games in the 1970s and 1980s brought a new emphasis and wave of research into gamification. In the last decade, great strides have been made in gamification of classrooms, technical learning, and computer science.

Some of these experiences are mediated directly by technology, using software platforms, video games, and other digital tools. Others are more analog in their implementation, but still actively and intentionally seek to apply principles of game, play, and competition directly onto the learning experience.

In game studies, the terms “games” and “play” are usually built from Caillois’ notion that paidia and ludus are the two poles of play[6], “free-form recombination of behaviors and meanings”[9] while ludus (or “g paidia (or “playing”) being a moreaming”) denotes the structured play that arises from rules and competition or goals.

So, games are characterized by an explicit and known system of rules that push one or more players towards specific goals.[19, 33]

To borrow from Deterding et al’s [8, 9] oft-cited work From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defining “Gamification”, we can summarize “gamification as:

- the use (rather than the extension) of design (rather than game-based technology or other game-related practices)
- elements (rather than full-fledged games)
- characteristic for games (rather than play or playfulness)
- in non-game contexts (regardless of specific usage intentions, contexts, or media of implementation).”[9]

So, if gamification is applying the principles of gaming to non-gaming contexts, what are those principles? Nah, et al [26] reviewed dozens of studies from across educational disciplines and distilled the following, general, principles of gamification.

- Points
- Levels and Stages
- Badges
- Leaderboards
- Prizes and Rewards
- Progress Bars
- Storylines
- Feedback

It is important to note that not all of these elements must exist to consider a learning experience “gamified.”

Stott and Neustaedter [27] has a more condensed list of gamification principles, limited to “Freedom to Fail, Rapid Feedback, Progression, and Storytelling.“

Clifford Lampe [28] sums up the basic principles of gamification to choice, rapid feedback, collaborative processes, and competition.

### Benefits of Gamification
Gamification has been shown to have a dramatic effect on learning outcomes[8, 9, 30], primarily through increasing the student’s intrinsic motivation[1, 7, 32, 41].

Extrinsic motivation drives a student to progress because of a grade or requirement, some external motivation.[31] Intrinsic motivation drives a student to attend class because “they hunger for more information, they want to be there, they are involved and their self-efficacy soars.”[12]

In order for a classroom to move from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation, it must become student-centric and the gamification of learning can be an important tool in that transformation.[12] 

The core game concepts of goal-focused activity, rewards, and progression provide the learner a situation and set of tools for the learner to take a more active role in the learning experience[13].

These external markers motivate the student to continue progressing, provides the student with a clear understanding of how she is progressing, and affords the student with (often incremental) steps to continue progressing. This progress reinforces the positive effects of learning and drives the student to work harder to progress more.

In many cases, the use (or combination) of cooperation and competitiveness compounds these motivation factors.

Cronk found that adding gamification elements to undergraduate learning increases student participation in discussions [7]

In their experimental study, Barrio, Morillas, and Soriano showed “that the impact of variables such as learner motivation, attention and learning performance are significantly higher in those learners exposed to gamification techniques.”[2].

### Gamification in Classrooms (generally)
A number of case studies specifically concerning gamification in formal classroom studies have been undertaken in the last several years.

Sanchez, Young, and Jouneau-Sion implemented a gamification platform called Classcraft for classroom management and reported positive feedback from both students and teachers. [35]

Flores and Figueroa describe many ways to gamify second language learning and highlight specific implementations both in and out of the classroom that have been successful in increasing retention, language skill, and motivation [11].

Classroom gamification has been either proposed or implemented in education relating to pharmaceutical training [37], Literacy education [20], and many other domains.

### Gamification in Computer Science Education
While there have been many instances of gamification applied to formal educational settings, there are relatively few instances of the gamification of computer science education, either in formal classrooms or informal learning contexts.

Perhaps the most used gamification of math and computer science education is Khan Academy. Morrison and DiSalvo [25] mapped Khan Academy’s use of gamification techniques (badges, progress bars, etc). Those techniques have undoubtedly helped Khan Academy reach more than 12 million active users every month[48] in 2017.

Studies have also found that students who use Khan Academy have reported higher scores on standardized tests[14]. How much of that success is directly related to the gamification is not known.

Iosup, Alexandru, and Epema[18] have applied gamification to undergraduate and graduate courses in technical education including Computer Organization and Cloud Computing including experimental studies with more than 450 students. 75% of them have passed the course on the first attempt and have found direct correlations between increasing student success and gamification elements, noting “Gamification seems to also foster interaction in the classroom and trigger students to pay more attention to the design of the course.” [18]. In addition, it has led to positive student assessments and volunteer testimonials.

Similarly, Villagrasa and Duran[43] describe an implementation of gamification techniques in a 3D Graphics Arts class. They added Problem Based Learning and Quest Based Learning to their curriculum in a specifically cooperative setting. The authors had proposed a study, but (as of 2018) the full findings of that study have not been presented. [43]

Li et al [23] integrated PeerSpace, an online social network and collaboration technology[10], into Computer Science education directly. The platform allows for limited collaboration, but no other gamification elements. The team introduced casual games, participation points, leaderboards, and enhanced collaboration to the platform[23].

The authors divided the class into a control group that used PeerSpace without any gamification elements and an experimental group that used a version of PeerSpace with the above elements and found that ”PeerSpace games increase site activity in students...The gamification features received very positive feedbacks from the students. An overall greater number of activities have been observed.”[23] 

Others have used gamification techniques to encourage the use of version control [39], gamify citizen science [4, 5], teach state control and object oriented programming to freshmen computer science students [35], and apply leaderboards to computer programming courses [12].

Finally, when discussing gamification of Computer Science courses, Berkling and Thomas [3] describes the setup for a gamified classroom for the subject of Software Engineering by implementing paths, choices, progress, points, and collaboration, among other gamification techniques. 

They show mixed results with no clear consensus, noting that “Students did not seem to be ready for autonomy,” and “gamification was viewed as unnecessary hindrance towards studying for the exams”.[3]

### Competitive Gamification
Most of the gamification we’ve discussed so far has been centered around either cooperative gamification or an individual-against-themselves from of gamification through progress and rewards. While students will invariably compare themselves to other student’s progress, the aim of these gamification techniques does not directly involve competition.

Competitive gamification, however, is a powerful tool in the teaching toolbox. 

Reeves and Read [29]  and Yee [46] both identify competition as one of the key elements in video games that attract players and motivate them to keep playing.

Even with the negative consequences of a lost competition, there is evidence of the positive effect competition can have when engaging people in activities,[40]. Research has shown that engaged learners have improved learning outcomes. [38].

Landers and Landers[21, 22] developed a theory of gamified learning and implemented competition techniques in a classroom. They used leaderboards, progress charts, and ranking (competition) with “time on task” performance and found “leaderboards supported a causal effect. Students with leaderboards interacted with their project 29.61 more times, on average, than those in a control condition.” [22].

Sepehr and Head’s[36] research used surveys and focus groups in an MBA classroom that had been gamified heavily using competition and found that their “overall findings...suggest that the use of competition as a game element to engage students in learning can be a very successful approach. Competition has the potential to compensate for the lack of skill in complex activities. [36]

Sepehr and Head noted two other findings relating to gamified competition. First, “immediate feedback is an important predictor of engagement in places [where] competition is a driving factor. Immediacy of feedback allows students to compare their scores with their colleagues and fosters the competition.” Second, “the context that was studied also included cooperation, which is believed to be necessary to complement competition”[36] which resonates with (and is informed by) the conclusions of Tauer and Harackiewicz [42]. Cooperation and Competition need not be mutually exclusive and often work well together.

Finally, Yu, Han, and Chan [47] “researched the impact of anonymous team competitions on students’ “motivation, satisfaction, and interpersonal relationships” noting that anonymous competition (in this that specific context, at least) was “a desirable feature in the design of future competitive game–based learning systems.”[47]
