**Titles I do not yet have are in *italics***

These are just highlights, and just of nonfiction. My wife and I have more than 2000 books, so I'm keeping it short.

My background is in Educational Psychology, and most of my "nonfiction" section is in anthropology and archaeology.
I haven't included most of those texts, but if someone's interested, I can.
I am just beginning to build my personal research library, and I'm super excited about it.

Also, take a look at [Awesome Game Studies](https://github.com/electricjones/awesome-game-studies) which I curate.
