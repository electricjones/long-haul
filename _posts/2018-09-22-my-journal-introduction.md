excerpt: What should you expect from my research journal? I don't know, either.

Dear Diary...

Okay, so the journal isn't going to be *that* informal, but it will be personal.

Here, I will be documenting my journey in research, development, and education. As I pursue various topics around computer science, systems/embedded programing, gaming, and conservation, I go through my various projects, classes, and papers. I also work with several research centers and will try to shed some light into the work we do.

I hope you will join me as I scatter-brain my thoughts. Elsewhere on the site will be more formal tutorials, reviews, and papers. This journal is about the *process* more than the *product*.
