excerpt: What should you expect from my research journal? I don't know, either.

Dear Diary...today I met a girl...

Actually, I've been really happily married for almost 5 years. You can get to know here. 
She's basically the most awesome person whose ever "person-ed".

Okay, so the journal isn't going to be *that* informal, but it will be personal.
I am essentially creating my own Ph.D. and research lab around Game Sciences, and I'm doing it in a city that is not known for its Gaming Culture (Houston, Texas).
There are a lot of things to love about the city, and it does have a thriving academic scene with scholars looking at gaming topics, to be fair.

So, this journal is going to be documenting my thoughts, feelings, struggles, and a-ha! moments along the way. 
It'll be mostly cathartic, but hopefully helpful as well.

You can expect chatter about
- Research projects and doing research
- Writing and submitting papers for peer review
- Choosing and taking courses
- General flim-flam and adventure in Game Sciences
