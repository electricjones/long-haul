excerpt: A process to discover and a description of my various research interests and how they relate.

***Note: This post represents my interests and (mostly dream) projects at a very specific point in time. For a more up to date digest, look at [About Me](https://www.electricjones.org/about) and [Projects/Games](https://www.electricjones.org/projects)***

There is a fairy-unicorn-dragon of a goal out there -- somewhere -- when it comes to the various research interests and projects I am constantly consumed by.
That is to say, that I am intentionally moving towards somethings:
1. A Game Sciences Research Lab that does research concerning and creates Impact Games
2. A Tenured professorship at a University that values my work and in a city with others who care about Game Sciences
3. Various specific projects around Adaptive Gaming, Educational Gaming, and Innovative Technology.
4. A network of fellow Game Arts and Sciences enthusiasts and professionals.

Those are ridiculously vague end-goals.
In addition to those pie in the sky dreams, I have various things that interest me now, things I'd like to work on "some day", and just cool ideas I can't let die.

The problem is there are limited ours in the day and limited days in my life.
Not to speak of resources.

I was really stumbling around this for a while, trying to think of how to get from point A to point Z.
How could I work on such large ideas in an incremental way.
How did these various, scatter-brain thoughts connect.

Connect.

Bring in the graphs.

I spent a couple nights white-boarding in my home, listing all of my interests and wanna-be projects.
I focused on the relatively mid-distance projects. Something I could reasonably get going in the next 5 years.
Then, I just drew lines. How did these connect? Which projects built off of others? Which interests were most prominent.

It wasn't mind blowing.
I didn't learn a bunch of new stuff about myself.
But, it *was* helpful. It helped me to see where I should start.

Once I had that map, I was able to break some of the more core ideas into smaller, incremental chunks.

And off to the races I ran.

So, I'm sharing my (not quite) most recent white board. 
Not because I expect it to make sense to everyone, it barely makes sense to me.
But because the **process** helped me immensely, and it may be something someone else out there in the cyber waves wants to try.

### Interests and Projects.
For fun, I'll annotate the board a bit, so it can make some sense, at least. Also see my [research interests](https://www.electricjones.org/about#research-interests) for a more formal description what what weird things I am into.

- The Squares are larger projects like a full Game or an Application
- The Circles are libraries (abstractly) that could be used in multiple games/applications and open sourced. Tools that do interesting things.
- The Underlines are broad research topics.
- Green squares are "games" in a traditional sense
- Blue squares are gamified apps of some kind
- Black squares are platforms used by or to make games

I haven't drawn **all** the relation lines. Everything would be connected to everything, lol.

**Storm Fury**: My personal sandbox game that allows me to explore innovative technological and game design elements. It's a (mostly) top-down, Zelda-ish game where the player uses color-mixtures of paint to affect the world. You can mix specific color combinations and it systemically alters the properties of everything in the world.

**Therapy Game**: A broad idea (with no concrete element yet) of a game to be used in the aide of counseling.

**Fake News**: A procedurally generated game that teaches and reinforces the skills needed to identify fake, opinionated, and biased news. Broad concept. Nothing concrete yet. Just a dream.

**Sci Ninja**: A gamified platform for citizen science and makering. Allows researchers to add projects and citizens to collect data. Also fun experiments. Some design work done and a little code. 

**Gamify Server**: A Restful server (and socket server) to keep track of badges, points, currency, etc. Some data work done. Nothing really concrete.

**Maker Platform**: Just an idea -- how can we make "packaged" games, algorithms, and wizards so that a non-game-developer can create a basic game in **hours**. Just in the dream stage for now.

**DI Platform**: Differentiated Instruction. A platform to integrate and coordinate games that adapt to a specific learner's profile, skill level, and interests.

**Blue Heart**: An ocean and river, open world, general education game.

**M Tour**: An indoor Augmented Reality Museum Tour/Creature Collection game.

**Dragon War**: Just a geo-game for fun. I don't want to say too much about this for now.

**Systemic**: Elements of games that affect other elements. System Gaming. Google it. It's pretty cool.

**Adaptive Games**: Games that "rewrite" themselves to a player's interest, profile, and other factors. Machine Learning.

**Wellness and Learning Profile**: A (dreamed of) Open Standard for Knowledge, Skill, and Wellness representation. A computer parsable graph of some kind that allows for things like cognitive tutors and adaptive games to work interoperablly.

**Emotion Games**: Affective and Emotive Gaming. Broad. Super broad.

**Games Democratization**: Opening up the creation of simple games to the world. Like iPhone and YouTube did for videos.

I think the rest is pretty self explanatory.

I hope this was helpful to someone. If not, it helped me get ahold of some things.
