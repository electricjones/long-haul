title: About Electric Jones (Michael)
---
Howdy, my name is Michael Wilson.

I am a scholar, storyteller, gamer, game maker, and computer scientist who focuses on the positive impacts of gaming on both individuals and society.
My degrees are in Anthropology and Educational Psychology, and I am currently pursing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

My primary interests involve Machine Learning, Data Science, AI, and robotics, especially where they intersect with educational technology and gaming.
I also focus on creating tools around the educational topics of individual differences, knowledge representation, and differentiated instruction.

## Background
- M.Ed. Educational Psychology from [Drury University](https://drury.edu) where I did my thesis on **Educational Storytelling**.
- M.A. Anthropology from [University of Houston](https://uh.edu) where I conducted a participant-observation ethnography of anime fandom, and wrote a larger thesis about constructing narrative identity.

## Research Interests
With a research background in Anthropology, Educational Psychology, Fiction, and Computer Science, my research can seem a bit -- disconnected.
In reality, most everything revolves around **Transformational Stories and Games**, that is games and stories that are intentionally created to **Teach**, **Heal**, and promote **Community Action**.

- Broadly:
    - **Games and Curriculum**: Games *in* and *as* teaching strategies for both content engagement and skill acquisition, in and out of the classroom.
    - **Game Development Democratization**: How can we democratize the game making process through better game development tools for the non-technical practitioner (teachers, etc.)
    - **Adaptive/Differentiated Gaming and Data Mining**: Games that change based on data about a player, using procedural generation and machine learning
    - **Digital/Analogue Game Hybrids**: Game controllers, feedback systems, and game design elements.
    - **Game Analysis and Cultural Studies**: Narrative Identity, elements of gaming, textual and experiential analysis, gaming culture folklife.

- More specifically:
    - Progression Systems, Skill Trees, and Learner Profiles as Data Structures and Algorithms
    - High performance decision engines for games to aid in systemic and adaptive (ai-driven) gaming
    - Procedural generation and animation based on Machine Learning
    - High performance, large scale, geo-location based games (both in game engine and game design)
    - Functional programming in game engine development
    - Digital / analogue computer and human interfaces for mixed (digital and table top) gaming
    - Innovative (robotic) input devices, and robotic gaming
