Howdy, my name is Michael Wilson.

There are substantial challenges facing humanity, each its own complex system of challenges. 
There are also stunning opportunities to tackle these challenges with a mixture of 
emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams. 

I want to be a part of that work, solving complex and difficult problems.

I am a scholar, storyteller, gamer, and computer scientist, and systems engineer.

My degrees are in Anthropology and Educational Psychology, and I am currently pursing a Master's of Science
in Computer Science from Georgia Tech with the ultimate goal of a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

My primary interests involve New Forms of Computing, Data Science, AI, and robotics, especially where they can be applied to domains of great impact like climate change and food production.

## Georgia Tech
I was just accepted to Georgia Tech's [Online Master's of Computer Science](http://omscs.gatech.edu/home).

I am really excited about the challenge and have plans to be really open my journey.

## Background
- M.Ed. Educational Psychology from [Drury University](https://drury.edu) where I did my thesis on **Educational Storytelling**.

- M.A. Anthropology from [University of Houston](https://uh.edu) where I conducted a participant-observation ethnography of anime fandom, and wrote a larger thesis about **constructing narrative identity**.
