title: About Electric Jones (Michael)
---

Howdy, my name is Michael (Electric Jones).

I am a scholar, storyteller, gamer, and computer scientist, and systems engineer. I first started programming in fourth grade (thank you Meadowbrook Elementary for have a one-computer lab) and haven't looked back. I am fascinated by how things work, how we can make them work better, and how we can use them to make *the world* better.

I trive on creative collaboration with smart, passionate people tackling complex, impactful problems.
This means uniting teams of people from different disciplines: engineers, artists, storytellers, organizers, and more.

My degrees are in Anthropology and Educational Psychology, and I am currently pursing a Master's of Science
in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.

I see computer science (and engineering in general) as tools for great impact. 
There is enormous value in sharpening the tool, or in advancing the tool for its own sake. I call this "Craft".

But a tool is meant to be used, and the applications for computer science are nearly endless. I call this "Domain".

My primary "Craft Interests" involve New Forms of Computing (high performance and embedded/realtime), AI, and robotics. The "Domains" I am most passionate about are climate change, ocean conservation, and civic action (especially information).

<!-- I believe in "Public Learning" and teaching by exploration from the bottom up. -->
