title: About Electric Jones
---
I am a scholar, storyteller, gamer, game maker, and computer scientist who focuses on the positive impacts of gaming on both individuals and society.
My degrees are in Anthropology and Educational Psychology, and I am currently pursing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

## Research Interests
With a research background in Anthropology, Educational Psychology, Fiction, and Computer Science, my research can seem a bit -- disconnected.
In reality, most everything revolves around **Transformational Stories and Games**, that is games and stories that are intentionally created to **Teach**, **Heal**, and promote **Community Action**.

My specific interests are at the intersection of:

**Educational Gaming**
My research is rooted in Educational Psychology and Individual Differences. 
I seek to understand what elements of game design are effective for different kinds of teaching and learning styles, subjects, and goals.
Both in and out of the classroom.

I am also interested in game making platforms that allow for the democratization of educational gaming.
Simple and effective tools and techniques that aide educational practitioners to integrate gaming into their teaching.

**Adaptive Gaming and Data Mining**
That is, put simply, games that change based on player factors. 
In some ways, all games are adaptive, but I am interested in integrating modern data science techniques and procedurally generated content to provide rich gaming experiences based on a deep understanding of the player and a close reading of that player's progressions.
So, the game gets to know you and builds itself around you. No two experiences are the same.

**Virtual Reality Training and Simulation**
My work with the [University of Houston Gaming Lab]() primarily concerns the application of Augmented and Virtual reality to training and assessment programs.

**Citizen Science and Maker-ing**
Research and development include toolsets and studies to promote the scientific process and way of thinking to the general public.

**Gamification: Conservation and Personal Responsibility**
By way of application, I have a passion for conservation. Many of my projects and games revolve around this and related subjects.
