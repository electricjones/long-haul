# Projects and Games
In alignment with my [research interests](/about) (and just because it's super fun), I lead and am involved in several, ongoing research projects and games.

**[Awesome Game Studies](https://github.com/electricjones/awesome-game-studies)**
A community-driven awesome list of resources for gaming scholarship, art, and sciences. Focused on general Game Scholarship Theory, Videogames, and Tabletop games.

**[Games Do Good List](https://github.com/electricjones/games-do-good-list)**
We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, and on and on.
This is a list of evidence-based voices on the other side. A collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.

**[Blog and Research Journal](/blog)**
As I work through my Ph.D. in Computer Science, I will chronicle my learning experience. Informally.
I also write essays, articles, guides, and musings about many topics including games, education, research, technology, and dragons (always there should be dragons).

**Report: Level Up Survey Project**
A research project to identify and record personal experiences with the positive aspects of gaming.

**Storm Fury**
This is my toy research game. Built in Godot (because of its expandability and open source nature), I use this game as a platform to test out research ideas.
Its an open world story about a wild-west-ish world where magic paint can change the attributes of the characters, world, and items.

I am currently working on:
- Better and more flexible progression maps, skill trees, and knowledge representations
- A _High Performance Decision Engine_ to calculate and respond to systemic changes in environment and from player actions
- _Procedural generation_ of tile maps
