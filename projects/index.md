# Projects and Games
In alignment with my [research interests](/about) (and just because it's super fun), I lead and am involved in several, ongoing research projects and games.

### Awesome Game Studies [resource] (SUBMODULE)
**[Blog and Research Journal](/blog)**
As I work through my Ph.D. in Computer Science, I will chronicle my learning experience. Informally.
I also write essays, articles, guides, and musings about many topics including games, education, research, technology, and dragons (always there should be dragons).

**Level Up Survey Project**
A research project to identify and record personal experiences with the positive aspects of gaming.

**Storm Fury**
This is my toy research game. Built in Godot (because of its expandability and open source nature), I use this game as a platform to test out research ideas like Adaptive Gaming, Procedural Generation, and Systemic Worlds.
Also, its a fun story about a wild-west-ish world where magic paint changes everything! Literally everything.
