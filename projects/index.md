# Projects and Games
In alignment with my [research interests](/about) (and just because it's super fun), I lead and am involved in several, ongoing research projects and games.

**[Awesome Game Studies](/awesome-game-studies)**
A community-driven awesome list of resources for gaming scholarship, art, and sciences. Focused on general Game Scholarship Theories, Videogames, and Tabletop games.

**[Blog and Research Journal](/blog)**
As I work through my Ph.D. in Computer Science, I will chronicle my learning experience. Informally.
I also write essays, articles, guides, and musings about many topics including games, education, research, technology, and dragons (always there should be dragons).

**[Games Do Good List](/games-do-good-list)**
We often hear of potentials dangers games: people getting lost in fantasy, encouraging violence, loss of ambition, and on and on.
These are the evidence-based and powerful voices on the other side. This list is a clearly one-sided collection of articles, stories, and research studies that show positive effects of videogames.
But, this list is a collection of sound research that shows games do good, too.

**Level Up Survey Project**
A research project to identify and record personal experiences with the positive aspects of gaming.

**Storm Fury**
This is my toy research game. Built in Godot (because of its expandability and open source nature), I use this game as a platform to test out research ideas like Adaptive Gaming, Procedural Generation, and Systemic Worlds.
Also, its a fun story about a wild-west-ish world where magic paint changes everything! Literally everything.

**Games for Learning Beyond Content Engagement**
The idea that games are a valuable way to engage students with content is wide-spread and well corroborated.
But, the power of games for learning does not end with making the topic fun or the content interactive.
Games also have the power to teach non-content based material such as skills.

This project is a survey of literature, ethnographic interviews, and a critical analysis of educational games marketing over the last 40 years.
